# FourierTransform

## Function

* Load image: Set the source image
* Set Result as Soruce Image: Move result image to source image.
* Fast Fourier Transform: Do FFT on source image and set result on result image.
* Inverse Fast Fourier Transform: Do IFFT on source image and set result on result image.
* Discrate Fourier Transform: Do DFT on source image and set result on result image.
  * Very slow!!!
* Inverse Discrate Fourier Transform: Do IDFT on source image and set result on result image.
  * Very slow!!!

- **But I think there are some error in the frame that the dataManager would not synchronize with image any time.**
